## DVFinal Project

1) We used various data sets and created Extract, Transform, and Load files for each data set to prepare the data to be uploaded to the Oracle SQL database

3) We created a ui.R file and server.R file to launch the Shiny app

4) We uploaded the finished shiny app onto the shinyapp.io after recreating or drawing inspiration from some of the more interesting Tableau graphs and outputs
